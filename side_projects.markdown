<h1>Side Projects & Visualizations</h1>
In my down time I enjoy taking on small side projects from time to time. Some are related to current events:
{%include GH_COVID_Dash.html%}.center {
  margin: auto;
  width: 50%;
  border: 3px solid green;
  padding: 10px;
}


Other times I like to explore data related to the holidays/seasons:
{%include figure_dash01.html%}
