My name is Matt Krieger and I have been working as a data analyst for 3 years in food manufacturing, supply chain, and CPG spaces. 
I primarily enjoy working with python and SQL for data wrangling and cleaning, as well as Tableau and Microsoft PBI for visualization and report creation. 
I specifically enjoy transforming time consuming and tedious processes into easy short automated ones, aesthetically pleasing visuals to deliver insights and KPIs, as well as in depth analytics. Although my journy is just beginning, I am excited to continue my knowledge in all of these areas and tools and appreciate you checking out my page! Have a look around and let me know what you think!
